# LicensePlateRecognition
A MATLAB App to explore license plate recognition steps using simple image processing techniques. You can interactively see how the location of characters in a license plate are located. Then each character is identified. You can change certain parameters to see their effect.

Please provide feedback on how I can make it better. Better yet please contribute.
